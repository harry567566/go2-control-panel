"""Send ONE high-level sport command to a REAL Unitree Go2 over the Ethernet cable.

THIS MAKES THE ROBOT MOVE. Clear 2 m around it and keep the remote in hand
(remote emergency stop: hold L2 then press B = damping).

The first argument is the Mac's network card on 192.168.123.x (en7 here):
    .venv/bin/python robot/cable_sport.py en7 standup        # lying -> standing, joints locked   (API 1004)
    .venv/bin/python robot/cable_sport.py en7 balance        # standing -> balance stand, ready to walk (1002)
    .venv/bin/python robot/cable_sport.py en7 move 0.2 0 0 2 # walk: vx vy vyaw seconds            (1008)
    .venv/bin/python robot/cable_sport.py en7 stop           # stop walking, stay standing        (1003)
    .venv/bin/python robot/cable_sport.py en7 standdown      # standing -> lying on the floor     (1005)
    .venv/bin/python robot/cable_sport.py en7 damp           # all motors go soft (damping)       (1001)
    .venv/bin/python robot/cable_sport.py en7 recovery       # get up again after a fall          (1006)
Add --dry-run to only print what would be sent (no network, no robot needed).
Add --yes to skip the 'Press Enter' question (the control panel asks in a dialog instead).

Suggested first session:  standup -> balance -> move (small) -> stop -> standdown -> damp
move reads the dog's sport mode first: standing but not balanced (for example right after standup) -> it sends
BalanceStand first, because Move does little otherwise; lying down -> it refuses. At the end it prints how far
the dog moved and turned, from the dog's own estimate (rt/sportmodestate).
Damp while STANDING makes the robot sink to the floor, so lie it down first.

move limits (clamped here): |vx| <= 0.3 m/s forward, |vy| <= 0.2 m/s left,
|vyaw| <= 0.5 rad/s turn left, seconds <= 3. StopMove is always sent at the end.
